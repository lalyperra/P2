							<h3>Hi, I'm Lauren</h3>
								<p>My passion is people!  Which means I define my success by my ability to help others succeed. Whether that is by recreating websites, editing site content, or delivering presentations for organizing work spaces and schedules.</p>
								<p>Besides my day job of web design and writing content to reach clients, I'm also a wife and mom of 2 kiddos.  I spend my week nights finishing my Master's degree and chauffeuring said kiddos to soccer, theater, and youth group.
									On the weekends, we play soccer tournaments all over Washington state and use that excuse to camp and make s'mores.
								<p>In my free time, I read voraciously and bullet journal every single day.  I've had so many people compliment my bullet journal addiction that I've started giving classes to share my passion. BUJOs help organize our thoughts and prioritize our schedules.
								We don't have much time so we need to make sure we're spending our time doing the things we truly love.</p>
								<p> #BuJo helps people do that.</p>

							<h3>Let's Work Together</h3>
								<p>I am currently in my last year of the Web Design and Online Communication Masterâ€™s program at the University of Florida, which is giving me the tools to create digital media driven to engage users. My courses teach strategic communication, ethical thought, and user-focused web design. Being part of such a tech-savvy degree means I am introduced to the newest technologies and trends; this insight leads to more relevant communication strategies and updated delivery methods to reach the targeted audience.
								</p>
								<p>Success for me is when I can use my skills to advance YOUR performance and improve YOUR business.  I have a proven ability to identify improvement and efficiency opportunities, develop cabilities to allow managers to execute on strategy, use communication skills to build trusting relationships with customers, and create online marketing campaigns across social media platforms.
